# Sparkled: The web-based LED animation sequencer
Sparkled is a tool I am working on in my spare time to sequence lights for a Christmas light display using addressable LED strips. 

Sparkled uses AngularJS and a neat library called wavesurfer.js, of which I am a contributor.

I haven't touched Sparkled in a while; other side projects demand my time. I will get back to it though.

*Update:* I'm starting work on Sparkled again! My initial plan to manage multiple LED strips at a distance ran into some hurdles, and put me off
the whole idea for a while. I've come up with a new idea though, and I'm keen to get back into building this thing!

Here's a peek of the UI:
