# Sparkled: The web-based LED animation sequencer
Sparked is a tool I am working on in my spare time to sequence lights for a Christmas light display using addressable LED strips. 

Sparkled uses AngularJS and a neat library called wavesurfer.js, of which I am a contributor.

I haven't touched Sparked in a while; other side projects demand my time. I will get back to it though.

Here's a peek of the UI:
